                Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!
                It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir,
                we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
                Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to
                attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up!
            </p>

            <p>
                But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land
                in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot
                get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give
                me that! Mine! Or I will help you not. don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out
                of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine!
                Artoo! Mine! Mine!
