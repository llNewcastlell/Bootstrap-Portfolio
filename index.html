                    I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him
                    up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare
                    to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I
                    think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
                    It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!

                    The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong
                    here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
                    Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him,
                    either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
